# \<reddit-api\>
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/emanguy/reddit-api-elements.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/emanguy/reddit-api-elements)

An element set for interacting with the Reddit API.

This is still a work in progress, but the intent is to provide multiple web components which can be used as data providers to other elements. These elements will be droppable, so no backend is required for accessing the Reddit API.
